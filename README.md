MapleTabs
==========

MapleTabs is a tab manager for chrome that uses navigation history to organize tabs.
Tabs are organized into a tree like data structure where tabs can be added in either two ways...
"Control+T" which will add a new tab as a sibling to the current tab 
or
"Control+Click" which will add a new tab as a child to the current tab.

The window will always show the current tab and all siblings to the current tab. If you open several new links from a page (as child tabs) and want to view them. You shift down a level in the tree. Likewise, if you want to go back to the parent tab, you shift up a level. The commands are as follows... 
"Command+Shift+K" - Shift up a level
"Command+Shift+M" - Shift down a level

**Currently only tested for Macs but should work for linux/Windows if "Control" is substituted for "Command".

The app was motivated by two ideas. 
First, I noticed that many of the tabs I open can easily be linked to the page I opened them from. For example, when I browse Reddit, I like to open all the links I'm interested in and browse through them. 
Second, I often wonder how I navigated to certain links and get lost in the browser's history when trying to navigate my way backwards. This app provides a potentially more intuitive way to backtrace your navigation history. 

Pictures will be added to help explain. Words are hard x _ x
