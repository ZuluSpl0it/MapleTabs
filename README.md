MapleTabs

hackRU Spring 2014 Project


MapleTabs is a tab manager for chrome that uses navigation history to organize tabs.
Tabs are organized into a tree like data structure which can viewed when clicking on the extension icon.
As shown...
(put picture of a tree here)



~How to use~
1. Install the extension 
	1. substeps
2.  

The window will always show the current tab and all siblings to the current tab. If you open several new links from a page (as child tabs) and want to view them. You shift down a level in the tree. Likewise, if you want to go back to the parent tab, you shift up a level. The commands are as follows... 

"Command+Shift+K" - Shift up a level

"Command+Shift+M" - Shift down a level

**Currently only tested for Macs

The app was motivated by two ideas. 

First, I noticed that many of the tabs I open can easily be linked to the page I opened them from. For example, when I browse Reddit, I like to open all the links I'm interested in and browse through them. 

Second, I often wonder how I navigated to certain links and get lost in the browser's history when trying to navigate my way backwards. This app provides a potentially more intuitive way to backtrace your navigation history. 

Pictures will be added to help explain. Words are hard x _ x
