Goal: Intuitive tab management by enforcing a tree like structure

-new tabs opened from a page are nodes of that page
-new tab created through the new tab command is a sibling of the previously visited tab
-Commands available that can navigate levels up/down
-clicking the icon shows a visual of the current tabs
-the visual can be manipulated to affect the actual tab organization
